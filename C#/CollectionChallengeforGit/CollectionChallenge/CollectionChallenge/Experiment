The experiment to make the code more efficient is to add two more data types. 
I added two more data types to make the comparison of ints more broad.
I added two extra testing numbers to test the efficiency of the computer by handling more data sets.
This provides more data variety since its not just a Vector(ArrayList), LinkedList and an Array. 
The two data types I am adding are lists and HashSets. This expermient will work with the first 3 digits
